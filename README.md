# NLW Agents

This project is a full-stack application developed during the NLW (Next Level Week) event. It consists of two main parts:

- **server/**: The backend API and database logic (see `server/README.md` for details)
- **web/**: The frontend web application (see `web/README.md` for details)

Each folder contains its own README with setup and usage instructions specific to that part of the project.
